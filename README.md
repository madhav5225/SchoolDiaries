# Android app which supports a parent-teacher 2-way communication that allows parents to monitor their kids activities in class.
</br>
Childs performance in school highly depends on how their parents are involved in their education.</br> 
This App supports a parent-teacher 2-way communication that allows parents to monitor their kids performance in school on the daily basis and supports a system that helps to develop a healthy parent-teacher relationship in a great way to improve their child’s performance in school.</br>
Kids are too young to share their day to day activities to parents, so this app bridges the gap between parents and their kids.</br>
This application provides teachers to share overall performance of a student including important notices, announcements, feedbacks, study materials, course-plan, attendance etc and help parents to ask any query and response for the same.</br>
